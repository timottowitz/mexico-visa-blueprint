# Blog System Documentation

## 📁 How This Blog System Works

This blog system is **fully programmatic** - meaning every blog post automatically gets:
- Professional author bylines with avatar
- SEO optimization (meta tags, JSON-LD structured data)
- Strategic CTA placement throughout content
- Consistent branding and styling

- Social sharing optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start: Adding a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Add Metadata
In `src/utils/blogUtils.ts`, add your post to the `BLOG_POSTS_METADATA` array:

```typescript
{
  slug: 'your-blog-post-slug',
  title: 'Your SEO-Optimized Title (under 60 chars)',
  excerpt: 'Compelling meta description under 160 characters',
  date: '2025-01-20',
  readTime: 'X min read',
  category: 'Immigration Law', // or other relevant category
  author: 'Mexico Immigration Lawyer',
  featured: false // Set to true for homepage featuring
}
```

### Step 2: Create Your Markdown File
Create `your-blog-post-slug.md` in this folder following this structure:

```markdown
# Your Main Title (H1 - only one per post)

*Published: January 20, 2025 | Reading time: 8 minutes*

Opening paragraph with strategic [internal links](/services/temporary-residency) and keyword focus...
