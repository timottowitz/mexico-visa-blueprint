# Mexican Citizenship Requirements 2025: Complete Naturalization Guide

The acquisition of Mexican citizenship through naturalization is a formal process governed by the Secretar√≠a de Relaciones Exteriores (SRE), representing the final step of integration for a foreign national. This comprehensive guide covers all pathways, requirements, and procedures for obtaining Mexican citizenship in 2025.

## Who Can Apply for Mexican Citizenship?
